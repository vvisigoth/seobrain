I'd like to add an option to the knowledge base/RAG functionality of the article generator. Add another flag "--tags" that can take a list of tags (tags can be multiple words). If these tags are submitted, then only index and retrieve text/markdown files with the corresponding tags in the yaml header. The yaml header looks as below:

```
---
tags:
  - midjourney
  - sref
  - images
---
```
