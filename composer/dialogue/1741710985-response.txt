There once was a code quite divine,
With composer and conductor in line.
    One talks to AI,
    While the other stands by,
To keep just five chats at a time!

The composer will handle requests,
While conductor performs all the rest.
    With context so neat,
    The system's complete,
Making this Python pair simply the best!
